            </p>
            <h5> Accomplishments: </h5>
            <p>
                There were many projects that needed covering at DFC, from system upgrades to migrating servers. I was given the opportunity to develop my career as an IT professional. While there, I used my spare time to work on exciting projects, such as; port patching
                and organising the server room, improving security with Mac address lockdown, building a new Host Server and migrating some physical servers to virtual machines and adding all devices to the domain. To add to the list of completed projects,
                I also rolled out Two Factor Authentication to those that handled sensitive information. Along side this role, I enjoyed thinking of new ways to improve the quality of service and security amongst our systems and users. This included the
                introduction of Ninjio, a service to provide IT Security Awareness Training for all members of staff, to help reduce the risk of phishing and other security breaches.

                There was an opportunity to work on an industry pioneering project. Here, I demonstrated my leadership skills by developing and training the Service Desk Team to manage the project and service workload. This meant that I was freed up to play an instrumental
                role in the companywide migration of VOIP systems utilising third party cloud and mobile app software, such as analysis, communication with relevant business areas, reporting on progress to management, and monitoring that activities were
                on specification. As a result, the project was successful, and I was rewarded with additional responsibility in managing the Service Desk team.
